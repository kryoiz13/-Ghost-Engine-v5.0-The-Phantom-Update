# 👻 Ghost Engine v5.0
### *Undetected WhatsApp Lyric Automation Engine*

---

## 📖 Overview

**Ghost Engine** is a high-performance Python dashboard designed to transcribe YouTube Music videos and "human-type" lyrics directly into WhatsApp. 

Unlike traditional API bots, Ghost Engine uses **simulated hardware input**, making it significantly harder for platforms to detect as automation. It acts as a "Ghost Pilot" for your keyboard.

---

## 🚀 Installation

To get the engine running, ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed, then run the following command in your terminal:

pip install youtube-transcript-api pyautogui

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

1.  **Input:** Paste any YouTube URL (Music Video) into the dashboard.
2.  **Extraction:** The engine scrapes the Closed Captions (CC) directly from YouTube.
3.  **Refinement:** The bot cleans the text, removing timestamps and non-lyric tags.
4.  **The Hand-off:** You get a **5-second window** to focus your WhatsApp chat window before typing begins.
5.  **Human Mimicry:** The bot types at a randomized speed with natural delays between blocks.

## ⌨️ Controls & Keybinds

The dashboard features built-in hotkeys for total control:

* **F1 — START:** Initiates transcription and starts the 5-second countdown.
* **F2 — PAUSE:** Instantly freezes the typing process.
* **ESC — KILL:** Emergency shutdown (Hard-stop all processes).
